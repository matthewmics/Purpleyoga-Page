                  Ashtanga Yoga Mysore style
                </div>
                <p>
                  Ashtanga Yoga is distinct among other styles of yoga for its
                  focus on individual instruction in a small group, the way it
                  was originally taught in Mysore, India. Mysore style is the
                  optimal way to learn Ashtanga Yoga and is suitable for
                  beginners. Each student practices their given sequence
                  (Primary, Intermediate or Advanced) at their own pace with
                  personal guidance, including hands-on adjustments and verbal
                  cues, from the teacher. You don't need any yoga experience to
                  begin Mysore practice.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  Step by step you learn the Primary Series, a dynamic flowing
                  sequence of asanas (postures) incorporating ujjayi (a
                  breathing technique), bandhas (internal "locks"), driste
                  (gazing point) and vinyasa (breath-synchronized movement). All
                  of these tools combined create heat in the body, improve
                  flexibility, develop strength, build stamina and focus the
                  mind.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  Because Mysore style is guided self-practice your start time
                  is flexible. Students quietly arrive and leave during the
                  class, each person completing their practice within the
                  session time. Beginners allow about 75 minutes. You are
                  welcome, by appointment, to observe a class and meet the

                <p>
                  Ashtanga Yoga has two practice methods: the traditional Mysore
                  style for individual instruction, and led classes where
                  students enjoy the combined energy of a group who follow the
                  teacher's count through all or part of the Primary Series.
                  While students may choose to only attend led classes, we do
                  encourage everyone to complement them with regular
                  <a href="classes.html#ashtanga">Mysore style</a> practice.

                <p>
                  <b>Half Primary Series</b> is sun salutations, standing poses
                  and the sitting poses up to Navasana plus backbends and
                  introduces the full closing sequence of inversions including
                  shoulderstand and headstand.<br />
                  <b>Full Primary Series</b> goes beyond Navasana into more
                  challenging asanas such as balancing poses plus backbends and
                  the full closing sequence.

                  Vinyasa Flow Yoga is creative, fluid, challenging and fun. The
                  teacher is free to improvise dynamic sequences drawn from the
                  infinite possibilities of yoga asanas. In Saturday's Level Two
                  class, <a href="profiles.html#cathy">Cathy Louise</a> blends
                  intermediate and some advanced poses at a vigorous pace.

                  Her flowing vinyasa style is based on popular classes she
                  taught at London's Triyoga center, classes she playfully
                  called swirly yoga. She typically begins her class with a
                  variety of sun salutations, progresses through a range of
                  asanas, including arm balances, backbends and inversions, and
                  ends with a deep relaxation.

                  Vinyasa, literally translated as "placing (the limbs) in
                  motion," describes yoga practice that synchronizes breath and
                  movement. It is the foundation for many of today's yoga
                  styles. Vinyasa combined with ujjayi (a breathing technique)
                  and bandhas (internal "locks") helps to focus the mind, build
                  strength and stamina, and create heat to improve flexibility,
                  reduce fat and eliminate toxins.

                <p>
                  Pregnancy is a time of change and celebration, as well as
                  anticipation and anxiety. Yoga brings great awareness to what
                  is going on within you and it gives you energy, restoring what
                  you are putting into baby and also preparing you for birth.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  Breath is the key. You will learn a technique that you can use
                  anytime and will be especially helpful during labor. The
                  breath is combined with postures (asanas) that safely
                  strengthen your arms and legs and stretch the torso and spine
                  to create space for growing baby. You may be familiar with
                  Kegal exercises and in yoga terms this is called mula bandha
                  (root lock). By practicing pelvic floor exercises you get a
                  good start for both labor and after baby is born. Calmness
                  comes from correct breathing and being in a friendly,
                  supportive environment where you can focus on baby and you.

                  Class is offered in-person and via Zoom. Due to space
                  limitations, please email or call (808) 944-8585 before coming
                  to class. No drop-ins. We recommend starting after your

                  Getting back into exercise after giving birth is not easy for
                  many new mothers, who find that just leaving the house is a
                  great effort. Coming to Mom &amp; Baby Yoga not only motivates
                  you to get out and about with baby, this fun and safe class is
                  revitalizing and relaxing.

                  Yoga exercises and movement combined with proper breathing
                  helps Mom restore the pelvic floor, regain the inner strength
                  of her abdomen and rediscover a sense of calm. It also
                  provides babies with a soothing environment to both interact
                  with Mom and experience their bodies in a new world. One of
                  the special things about the class is that you are in a
                  supportive space where you can take time out to nurse. Also,
                  baby can choose to participate in the class, have a cry or
                  fall asleep!
